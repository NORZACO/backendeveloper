        :first - selects the first element meeting the condition.
        :last - selects the last element meeting the condition.
        :even- selects even elements meeting the condition.
        :odd - selects odd elements meeting the condition.
        :gt() - selects all elements of indices greater than the index within the matched set.
        :not() - selects all elements not matching the given selector.
        :eq() - selects the element at index n within the matched set.
        You can see more filters in the official documentation in the READ section.

    For now, let's look at an example using the following filters:
    <div id="example">
        <p id="para1" class="classA">Note an example on how to use :gt() :not() and :eq() filters. The font size is
            changed only for paragraphs from three to five, as the second paragraph has index 1 â€“ indices start from 0.
            The: eq filter selects an element at a specified index from all found elements, so in our case, p:eq(2)
            returns our third paragraph. By applying the :not() filter, we change the font of all our paragraphs beside
            the second one to Comic Sans MS..</p>
        <p class="classA">The second paragraph.</p>
        <p class="classB" id="para3">The third paragraph.</p>
        <p class="classB" id="para4" lang="en-us">The fourth paragraph.</p>
        <p class="classA" id="para5" lang="en-gb">The fifth paragraph.</p>
    </div>
</body>
