            In this section, we’ll focus on more advanced filters that focus on the content or position of the element,
            specifically: <br><br>
            :contains() filter – selects elements whose content contains certain text.<br><br>
            :parent filter – selects elements that have at least one child node (can be an element or text).<br><br>
            :has() – selects elements that contain at least one element that matches the specified selector.<br><br>
            :first-child / :last-child – returns all elements that are the first/last child of their parent.<br><br>
            :first-of-type / :last-of-type – returns all elements that are the first/last among all the siblings of the
            same element name.<br><br>
            nth-child() – select n-th child of their parent, we can use the n variable, for example, nth-child(2n) will
            select all even children.<br><br>
